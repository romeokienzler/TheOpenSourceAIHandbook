# Motivation
The business intelligence and data warehousing technology stack was disrupted when new economy technology companies solved problems with open source which haven’t been hardly solvable with the established BI and DWH tooling. Although proven, this technology is very slowly finding its way into the traditional Fortune 500, although they are responsible for a large margin of global GDP.

Business stakeholders are highly unsatisfied with the current situation. The established BI/DWH tools and services they find within their company doesn’t fit their needs and the modern world of open source data scientists neither they nor their employees understand.

New economy companies became global leaders without any of those BI/DWH technologies but traditional companies are struggling in making the jump.

Defining and teaching an open source self-service data science framework perfectly fits the needs of such companies with their architectes, developers and data scientists who are in the process of doing the jump.

# Target audience
This book is a source of knowledge for data scientists and AI engineers on using the open source self-service data science platform defined in the architecture section of this book. This is not a book to be read and forgotten. This is a book which sits on your desk to help you in your day to day work with:

* Data Ingestion (Apache Spark)
* Storage Layer / Data Lake (Ceph, S3/COS, Apache Iceberg)
* Data Exploration (jupyter lab, seaborn)
* Dashboarding (Apache Superset)
* Model Development (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
* Model Evaluation (TensorBoard, AI Fairness, AI Explainability, Adversarial Robustness)
* Model Deployment (Seldon, KNative)
* Virtualization (Kubernetes)
* Pipelining (Kubeflow Pipelines)

Using the COVID-19 open data set in all recipes for consistency makes it easy to connect to the examples and apply them to your problem sets.
