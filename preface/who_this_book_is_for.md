This book is a source of knowledge for data scientists and AI engineers on using the open source self-service data science platform defined in the architecture section of this book. This is not a book to be read and forgotten. This is a book which sits on your desk to help you in your day to day work with:

* Data Ingestion (Apache Spark)
* Storage Layer / Data Lake (Ceph, S3/COS, Apache Iceberg)
* Data Exploration (jupyter lab, seaborn)
* Dashboarding (Apache Superset)
* Model Development (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
* Model Evaluation (TensorBoard, AI Fairness, AI Explainability, Adversarial Robustness)
* Model Deployment (Seldon, KNative)
* Virtualization (Kubernetes)
* Pipelining (Kubeflow Pipelines)

Using the COVID-19 open data set in all recipes for consistency makes it easy to connect to the examples and apply them to your problem sets.
